# project

This repository was used to practice file naming conventions, file organization, and using conda for environment and packages management.

The repository includes a dataset, python scripts, and a Report.ipynb file that allows the import of the dataset, visualization of the data, and training and evaluating of a machine learning model. 

To run Report.ipynb, you will need to use the environment.yaml file, which lists the following dependencies:
  - python>=3.10
  - ipykernel (to support the use of the environment in jupyterlab)
  - scikit-learn=1.3.0 (the version used to run Report.ipynb - later versions of the package may also be acceptable)
  - pandas
  - matplotlib

All data, scripts, and files were sourced from: https://github.com/yuliaUU/files_to_copy
